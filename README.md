A simple python script:

- This script offers an efficient method to assess the strength of passwords and generate random passwords that adhere to specific criteria.
- It checks the password against several criteria, such as minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- If the entered password does not meet these criteria, it provides feedback on the missing criteria and gives the option to generate a random password that meets the requirements.
- If the user chooses to generate a random password, it generates one and hides it with asterisks, giving the option to unhide the characters if desired.
